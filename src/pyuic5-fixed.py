# The pyuic5 tool drops the contents margins of layout widgets, but some versions
# of pyuic5 have a bug that makes it identify normal widgets as layout widgets
# resulting in broken layouts. The brickv .ui files were created based on PyQt4.
# To avoid having to chase down all the places where the broken pyuic5 erroneously
# drops contents margins of normal widgets just monkey patch pyuic5 to pretend
# that there are no layout widgets at all to get back to the old pyuic4 behavior.
