        * Index 3: Row end (has to be smaller then 60).

        The algorithm to generate the high contrast image is applied to this region.

        Dampening Factor: This parameter is the amount of temporal dampening applied to the HEQ
        (history equalization) transformation function. An IIR filter of the form::

         (N / 256) * previous + ((256 - N) / 256) * current

        is applied, and the HEQ dampening factor
        represents the value N in the equation, i.e., a value that applies to the amount of
        influence the previous HEQ transformation function has on the current function. The
        lower the value of N the higher the influence of the current video frame whereas
        the higher the value of N the more influence the previous damped transfer function has.

        Clip Limit Index 0 (AGC HEQ Clip Limit Low): This parameter defines an artificial population that is added to
        every non-empty histogram bin. In other words, if the Clip Limit Low is set to L, a bin
        with an actual population of X will have an effective population of L + X. Any empty bin
        that is nearby a populated bin will be given an artificial population of L. The effect of
        higher values is to provide a more linear transfer function; lower values provide a more
        non-linear (equalized) transfer function.

        Clip Limit Index 1 (AGC HEQ Clip Limit High): This parameter defines the maximum number of pixels allowed
        to accumulate in any given histogram bin. Any additional pixels in a given bin are clipped.
        The effect of this parameter is to limit the influence of highly-populated bins on the
        resulting HEQ transformation function.

        Empty Counts: This parameter specifies the maximum number of pixels in a bin that will be
        interpreted as an empty bin. Histogram bins with this number of pixels or less will be
        processed as an empty bin.

        The default values are
